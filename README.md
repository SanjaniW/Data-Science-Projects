Explore the collection of projects that showcase statistical analysis, machine learning, data analysis, deep learning and more. Each project has its own folder with codes, reports etc. I'm open to collaborations and appreciate feedback so feel free to reach out. Let's explore the exciting world of data science together!
## Projects
1. [Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/SanjaniW/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Diamond%20Price%20Prediction)
    -  **Description:** The project predicts the price (in US dollars) of the diamonds based on their features. This was done by a team of 4 members including myself.
    - **Technologies Used:** The codes uses various statistical and machine learning techniques. R was used as the programming language.
    - **Results:** The Random Forest model performed very well with an accuracy of 98%

2. [Abalone Age Prediction](https://github.com/SanjaniW/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Abalone%20Age%20Prediction)
    -  **Description:** The project predicts the age of an abalone based on its physical measurements. This was done by a team of 4 members including myself.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses various statistical, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Python was used as the programming language.
    - **Results:** The Random Forest model performed very well with an accuracy of 86%

3. [Prediction of the Leptospirosis Status of the Patient](https://github.com/SanjaniW/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Leptospirosis%20status%20prediction)
    -  **Description:** The project predicts the leptospirosis status of the patient based on their demographic and clinical data. This was a kaggle competition between the students taking the data science module. There were 32 competitiors and I had the best entry. 
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses various statistical techniques. Python was used as the programming language.
    - **Results:** Logistic regression model performed very well with an accuracy of 91%
      
4. [Smoke Detection](https://github.com/SanjaniW/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Smoke%20Detection)
    -  **Description:** Build a model to detect smoke with the help of IOT data and trigger a fire alarm. This was done by a team of 4 members including myself.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebook demostrates a detailed EDA and model fitting. Python was used as the programming language.
    - **Results:** The Random Forest model performed very well with an accuracy of 99.9997%
